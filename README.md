## PIR module

Module reports high after a trigger for a duration of 1 second.  
Inbetween triggers there is a minimum 3 second delay.   
This is a limitation from the PIR module.  

Looking at the module, facing buttons, dome up:  
- Left pot meter is sensitivity
- Right pot meter is trigger delay. (All the way to the left is minimum 3 sec)
